## Abastract

A fruit spoilage detection system is an approach to accurately identify and detect spoilage in various foods through image processing. Manual identification of fresh and rotten fruits are time consuming and prone to errors hampering efficient fruit supply chain management. The following project aims to develop a fruit spoilage detection system via a desktop application using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately detect spoilage in various fruits. Vision algorithms, such as OpenCV, have been used to preprocess the image of the fruit. A CNN has been used to extract the features from fruit images, and SoftMax has been used to classify the images as fresh and rotten fruits. To further enhance the system’s accuracy, data augmentation techniques, such as image rotation and flipping, have been employed to increase the diversity of the training dataset. As a proof of concept, the performance of the fruit spoilage detection system was evaluated on a dataset of apples, bananas, oranges, and green grapes. The proposed system is beneficial for a wide range of users including consumers, vendors, and fruit industry professionals thereby promoting fruit safety, minimizing waste, and making informed decisions about the fruits they consume or sell. Our fruit spoilage detection system, leveraging advanced image pre-processing techniques and a robust CNN, has demonstrated good accuracy in identifying and classifying fresh and rotten fruits. 

## Aims 

The primary aim of project is to develop an automated fruit spoilage detection system capable of accurately identifying and categorizing fresh and rotten fruits.

## Conclusion

The project has utilized deep learning and computer vision to detect spoilage on fruits like apple, orange, grapes and banana. The ultimate goal of distinguishing freshness and rottenness of fruits has been achieved by the model. For providing higher efficiency and adaptability, we developed a combined generator that integrates multiple pre-processing steps while addressing the limitations of ImageDataGenerator.

We created desktop app using Tkinter for enhanced user interface providing users with seamless interaction experience with fruit spoilage detection. The model successfully identified spoilage patterns in various fruits under diverse scenarios during testing phase. This comprehensive project not only showcased our expertise in machine learning and computer vision but also underscored the practical application of these technologies in addressing real-world challenges.


## Future Enhancement

• This project is an image-based spoilage detection system, but it could be expanded as a real time video-based spoilage detection system.

• To broaden the application, we can add varieties of fruits with proper dataset.

• Infrared scanning and gas sensors can be integrated for spoilage detection of fruits whose state cannot be determined by outer surface.
